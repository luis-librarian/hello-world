# hello-world
my first Git-Hub repository - testing and learning
My name is Luis F. Interiano C. I was born in Honduras, grew up in New Orleans, moved to Baton Rouge, La., and now live in Port Allen, Louisiana.
I am a Public Librarian in Adult Services at West Baton Rouge Library (www.wbrpl.com) 
I want to sharpen my digital skill-set and, though I learned about GitHub when it launched ten years ago but never really checked on it until I heard the audio-book of "Thank You for Being Late" by Thomas Friedman about how the digital world is changing the real world.
Glad to here. New to coding but I actually had a couple of years of computer science at LSU & U of New Orleans back in 1979-80 with Fortran, Pascal, PL-1, PL-C, Pascal, Asssembler and other now ancient programming languages on a huge IBM Mainfram and a VAX-11-780 machines. New coding languages seem a lot easier!
Please send me tips and corrections! I love to learn new efficiencies and meet new virtual friends. - Lu
